                <h2 class="topic">About Me</h2>
                <br />
                <p>I am a self-taught, front-end web developer. How did I decide to become a front-end developer? It
                    started about 4 years ago when a friend suggested that I apply for a technical position at his
                    company when he found out I was not passionate about accounting anymore. It was a software content
                    integrator position at Collins Aerospace in their interactive map division. This was the spark of my
                    new passion in the technology field.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My main duty was configuring software contents for commercial airlines like Virgin, Korean Air,
                    Etihad, etc. The work involved modifying HTML, CSS, XML, MySQL database, and content files. These
                    content sets would then be packaged, loaded into onto LRU hardware or mobile devices, quality
                    checked, documented, and uploaded to the customer by me. The work was very technical, required a
                    good understanding of different types of software, lots of problem solving, and an openness to learn
                    continuously. I loved it.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>I took on additional duties outside my job scope as a member of Content Group to manage, create, and
                    update baseline contents for products across different platforms. I paticipated in user interface
                    designs, created contents with Photoshop, styled GUI through HTML/CSS, and tested user experience. I
                    was very passionate and excited about my job. Nevertheless, good things do come to an end. It came
                    when company decided to move its Airshow division back to Cedar Rapids, Iowa after it merged with
                    another company. However, this is not the end.</p>
                <br />
                <p>It is a beginning for me. In searching for what I wanted to do next, I found that web development
                    offered me a way to continue my path in the technology field. I am already familiar with HTML, CSS,
                    content management, design, and software testing. I researched what it took to become a front-end
                    developer and got to studying. Putting the effort into learning front-end web development for these
                    past months have been a struggle and a marvel as well. From only making modifications of existing
                    HTML and CSS codes at my previous job to now building webpages from scratch, I feel accomplished and
                    ready to learn more to become an even better developer.</p>
